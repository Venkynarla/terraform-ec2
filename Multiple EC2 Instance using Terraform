Creating multiple EC2 instances using Terraform on Windows 10.

Files:
provider.tf
variables.tf
main.tf
config.sh

## Step 1 ##
In your user local directory, create a folder named ".aws". 
Also create a file named "credentials" with your AWS credentials.

## Step 2 ##
Download Terraform (https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.7/terraform_0.14.7_windows_amd64.zip)
Create a folder with a name of your taste and place the "terraform.exe"

## Step 3 ##
In that same folder you just created, create the files I mentioned in the beginning of this gist (provider.tf, variables.tf, main.tf and config.sh).
Those files content is available on this gist.

## Step 4 ##
At this point you should be able to start using terraform.
To do that, open your command line and make sure you're placed in the directory you created in the step 2.
After that, insert the following commands:
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
