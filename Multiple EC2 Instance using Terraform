## Step 1 ##
In your current user directory, create a folder named ".aws". 
Also create a file named "credentials" with your AWS credentials.

## Step 2 ##
Download Terraform (https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.7/terraform_0.14.7_windows_amd64.zip)
Create a folder with a name of your taste and place the "terraform.exe" file.

## Step 3 ##
In that same folder you just created, create the files: "provider.tf", "variables.tf", "main.tf" and "config.sh". 
These files are available on this gist.

## Step 4 ##
At this point you should be able to start using terraform.
To do that, open your command line and make sure you're placed in the directory you created in the step 2.
After that, insert the following commands, one by one:

terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply
